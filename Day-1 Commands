As in learning stage of Devops, I have explored commands,discussions and concepts like:

4 ways of installing O/s
Terms like : Contanerixation

Step-1: Launch AWS linux instance in AWS:
switch to root 
1)sudo su-root

To check wheather the devops is launched or not:

2)rpm -q docker & 3) rpm -q docker ce

Install docker

#yum install docker

Check docker

systemctl status docker

#docker ps

To install a O/S we need a O/S image (available in hub.docker.com)

#docker pull ubuntu:14.04
To run docker
# docker run -t -i ubuntu:14.04

Now the container will be launched and to stop the image

exit and to conterol from host O/S like linux

docker stop (pass container)id)
