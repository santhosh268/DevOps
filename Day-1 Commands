As in learning stage of Devops, I have explored commands,discussions and concepts like:

Solman Hykes

4 ways of installing O/s
Terms like : Contanerixation

Step-1: Launch AWS linux instance in AWS:
switch to root 
1)sudo su-root

To check wheather the devops is launched or not:

2)rpm -q docker & 3) rpm -q docker ce

Install docker

#yum install docker

Check docker

systemctl status docker

#docker ps

To install a O/S we need a O/S image (available in hub.docker.com)

#docker pull ubuntu:14.04
To run docker
# docker run -t -i ubuntu:14.04

Now the container will be launched and to stop the image

exit and to conterol from host O/S like linux

docker stop (pass container)id)


Day -2 Commands (Pics)

Day-3 Commands
Here today we have read the content files of Webserver with webclient

Commands used 
3 ways to set webserver in the O/S

1) yum install httpd

2) cd /var/www/html

and then create file in this location.

3)run systemctl start httpd 

    (or)

  httpd

and in the server run curl htt://webserver_ip_add/file_Name

and that's it. the setup is ready

Ctrl+P+Q ---> to come out the terminal instead of closing it.

docker exec Container_Namr Command_Name
ex: docker exec webclient curl http://172.0.1.2 sai.html
(Running docker commands from Base O/S)

free -m (To check the RAM of a base O/S)

lscpu  --> No.of CPU's

df - h too see the hard disk of base os

The data is stored permenantly only if it is connected to external device or H/w

So the command is : docker run -it --name OS1 /data:/var/www/html/posts centos:7.

In this case in my base O/S folder data is already created and in the container we have created a folder called as posts.

Through this although the container got deleted, the data will be stored in data folder which is created in the base o/s (i.e., need to create before launching the conatainer).
